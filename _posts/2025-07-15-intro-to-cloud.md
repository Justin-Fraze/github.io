The Cloud - the ignomious term used ubiquitously in IT. But what is it?

First of all, the cloud is short for "cloud computing." That's important because that's the nature of it--a concept of computational resources. Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the Internet. 

These services can include:
- Servers
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Software
- Analytics
- Artificial Intelligence

Cloud computing is powerful because it allows for sharing. This sharing can occur for a lot of people all at once who can access it when they want. Basically, companies provide outsourced services for clients. 

Key Characterisitics of the Cloud:
1. On-demand access. Clients can access resources at any time.
2. Accessibility. Clients can access resources at any time.
3. Scalability. Clients can easily scale up or down based on need.
4. Cost Effciency. Clients pay only for what they use, so they avoid unneccesary hardware investment.

Now that you got this basics, consider an analogy.

The Cloud is like Renting an Apartment vs. Owning a House
🏠 Owning a House (Traditional IT):
--> You buy the house, maintain it, and fix everything yourself.
--> You need to buy land, build it, install utilities, and handle repairs.
--> Expensive upfront, but you have full control.

This is like owning your own physical servers and data center.

🏢 Renting an Apartment (Cloud Computing):
--> You rent the space you need.
--> The landlord maintains the building (repairs, power, security, etc.).
--> You pay monthly and can move to a bigger or smaller apartment as needed.

This is like using the cloud: you rent computing power, storage, or services and only pay for what you use.

So instead of spending a lot of money and time building and managing your own IT infrastructure, you "rent" what you need from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Which brings up a great point. You probably already use these services in everyday life from school, work, and personal uses! Google Drive? A cloud-based storage service.
