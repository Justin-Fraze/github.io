The Cloud - the ignomious term used ubiquitously in IT. But what is it?

First of all, the cloud is short for "cloud computing." That's important because that's the nature of it--a concept of computational resources. Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the Internet. 

These services can include:
- Servers
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Software
- Analytics
- Artificial Intelligence

Cloud computing is powerful because it allows for sharing. This sharing can occur for a lot of people all at once who can access it when they want. Basically, companies provide outsourced services for clients. 

Key Characterisitics of the Cloud:
1. On-demand access. Clients can access resources at any time.
2. Accessibility. Clients can access resources at any time.
3. Scalability. Clients can easily scale up or down based on need.
4. Cost Effciency. Clients pay only for what they use, so they avoid unneccesary hardware investment.
